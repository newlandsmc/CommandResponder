###CommandResponder

There is nothing much to config or tell about this plugin

```YAML
spawn:
  enabled: true
  message: "<red>There is no /spawn on this server! Use /home to go home."
back:
  enabled: true
  message: "<red>There is no /back on this server!"
```

This is the base config..They key value represents the command name that needed to be registered.
Enabled is basicaly should the command be enabled or not and message is the response.

You can add as many as commands and messages there.
